In quantitative research of the financial domain, sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) aims to quantify investor sentiment (such as bullish, bearish, or neutral) from textual data and serves as a useful feature that complements traditional financial and economic indices reflecting fundamentals and captures perceived risk or market outlook. By incorporating sentiment, forecasting models can be improved in downstream tasks such as forecasting market trends, trading volume, and risk [2]-[5].\nHowever, the context of financial texts is often subtle and complex.

Although pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) have gained increasing attention in the financial domain such as FinBERT [11], FinGPT [12], and BloombergGPT [13], which consistently outperform traditional NLP methods on general benchmark tasks [14], many well-researched NLP tasks have not yet been effectively grounded in financial applications.\nFor Q1, it is an aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task in the NLP domain, which involves labeling the sentiment of different entities within a sequence. Thus to solve Q1, we finetuned a BERT to perform ABSA in an end-to-end manner.\nFor Q2, the knowledge graph technology in the NLP domain is a powerful tool for capturing associations and enabling retrieval for big data. With it, we can model the transmission of industry-level risk to related individuals using the relationships between firms and their associated industries. Thus to solve Q2, we first transform the text sentiment into a topic view, then use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on a knowledge graph to propagate it to the relevant industries, and finally to the corresponding firms.\nFor Q3, considering a time series composed of sentiment values at continuous but distinct time points, in order to filter out noise and extract a smooth latent trend, we can apply smoothing functions from signal processing. Thus to solve Q3, we aggregate the firm-specific and industry-specific sentiment and apply wavelet smoothing to filter out noise, ultimately obtaining a composite sentiment time series that reflects long-term trends and considers interactions among texts.\nTherefore, the overview of our framework is shown as Fig. 1 and our contributions in this work are as follows:"

The former outputs the overall sentiment of a sentence in an end-to-end manner, whereas the latter is treated as a sequence labeling problem that identifies the sentiment of a specific target within the sentence. However, traditional methods assume a single overall sentiment at the whole-document level, i.e., SLSA, which \"may not be the case in practice\" [15], especially in the financial market. Early research primarily focused on dictionary-based methods quantifying sentiment by counting positive and negative words, which struggle to account for domain-specific semantic subtleties [7]. As data availability increased, researchers began adopting machine learning techniques such as Naïve Bayes classifiers [16], [17], which rely on manual feature engineering, thus limiting their ability to capture the nuanced meaning of financial terminology.\nThis limitation was addressed with Transformer-based architectures due to the powerful representation capabilities of self-attention. Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models (LLMs) not only outperform traditional models on the SLSA benchmark using the FPB [18] and FiQA-SA [19] datasets, but also achieve strong performance on the ABSA benchmark, indicating that this task in the NLP domain has been effectively addressed. We observe that as a discriminative task, discriminative PLMs outperform generative LLMs in SA. Notably, FLANG-ELECTRA [20] achieved the best results, attaining an F1-score of  "

However, in quantitative research, SA is seldom treated as a more fine-grained ABSA task using Transformer-based models [11].\nSince the concept of an industry or sector exists primarily in financial markets, it is rarely discussed in the NLP domain. In recent years, some studies have explored sentiment consistency among related firms within the same industry. Liu et al. constructed an \"enterprise knowledge graph\" of firms and showed that ignoring correlations (e.g., industry co-movement) can result in missing important spillover effects [21]. Jochem et al. demonstrated that bias can propagate along supply chains [22]. Cao et al. highlighted that industry-level sentiment or news can permeate to firm-level sentiment via graph links or information diffusion paths [23]. However, none of these studies explicitly define or utilize firm-specific sentiment.\nAnother key theme is how sentiment effects play out over time including latency and persistence. Studies often find that market reactions to sentiment are not instantaneous [24], i.e., news may have a lagged impact or gradual diffusion. DeFond et al. documented that bond investors initially overreact to bad earnings news, and then correct this overreaction after the official announcement [25], indicating that sentiment takes time to fade away. However, in current quantitative forecasting models that incorporate sentiment, we have not observed any work that explicitly accounts for such lag effects."

The process of a single text is shown in Fig. 3. After forwarding the text through BERT, we obtain both sentence-level and token-level embeddings. Since the same text may describe multiple bonds, we extract the embeddings of each bond-related token, stack them together, and then refer to the mean-max pooling algorithm [27] to obtain the global representation of the bond. The sentence-level embedding is then concatenated with this representation and passed through an MLP to forecast the sentiment polarity with the highest probability, where the highest probability means the MLP outputs the probabilities of the three polarities: negative, neutral, and positive. Specifically, the mean-max pooling in our ABSA subtask for single text can be described as Algorithm. 1.\nAlgorithm 1: Mean-Max Pooling Input: labeled  "

For example, the highlighted ① refers to the mid-2015 Chinese Stock Market Turbulence, during which a large number of retail investors, affected by short-selling and leverage mechanisms, began to sell off stocks massively. As a result, the bond market was severely impacted, and sentiment across all industries remained depressed for several months. ⑥ corresponds to the end of 2022, when the Chinese government abandoned the \"Zero-COVID Policy.\" The economy, previously constrained by the pandemic, began to recover, leading to a shift in"

The visualization is shown in Fig. 8. The third subplot, \"Season,\" indicates that industry sentiment does not exhibit significant seasonality. The fourth subplot, \"Resid,\" shows that the noise distribution in the series remains relatively stable, with few outliers. The marked bearish period corresponds to the social event: In early 2018, China announced an early subsidy phase-out for new energy vehicles, starting the industry elimination competition."

Subsequently, the bond experienced a prolonged bearish sentiment. Although the situation temporarily improved at the end of 2015 due to a decline in the yield on 10-year government bonds, the company ultimately defaulted under continued financial strain and structural adjustment policies, accompanied by a renewed downturn in sentiment."

In this work, we independently constructed a multi-source heterogeneous dataset and leveraged PLMs and LLMs to extract firm-specific and industry-specific sentiment from both the micro-level and meso-level perspectives, and aggregated them using wavelet smoothing. Empirical analysis demonstrates that the composite sentiment extracted by our framework significantly improves the forecasting of bond credit spreads of the Chinese bond market. This expands the feature sources for bond default forecasting models and provides a valuable reference for using unstructured text in the study of the financial market.\nLimitations and Future Work. This work focuses solely on the Chinese bond market and selects bond default risk forecasting as the only downstream task. However, this paradigm of sentiment analysis for financial texts can be extended to other asset classes and downstream tasks in the financial market, including equities and derivatives."

    "en": "Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types."

Major financial releases from government sectors often trigger market movements by shaping investors' expectations and evaluations of economic conditions, asset growth potential, and associated risks. For example, during the FOMC meeting on March 16, 2020, the Fed's emergency rate cut to 0-0.25% sharply altered investors' economic outlook, resulting in a massive sell-off. Major indices, including the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones, dropped by over 10%, marking the steepest single-day decline since 1987. These salient macroeconomic events cause reactions in financial assets, establishing causal relationships between events and financial assets."

The first line of approaches utilizes text feature-based models, where language models, ranging from self-crafted RNN-based architectures to pre-trained transformers, embed sentiment information into text vectors, and then stock movements are predicted as a binary classification task (e.g., hawkish vs. dovish). The second line of methodology focuses on historical time-series data, treating stock price movements as a regression problem. Recently, transformer-based architectures have been applied for time-series prediction, including Informer, FedFormer, and AutoFormer, etc. However, both of these directions typically focus on a single modality, neglecting multi-dimensional information. The third line of research adopts a multi-modality approach, leveraging multiple types of data sources to enhance forecasting performance. For instance, studies like incorporate textual, video, and audio data from FOMC meetings alongside corresponding market movements. While these approaches show promise for event-driven financial forecasts, they face three major limitations:"

CAMEF integrates time-series and textual features through specially designed multi-feature fusion techniques, time-series decoding mechanisms, and causal learning strategies. By conducting a thorough review of financial literature, we identify six types of salient macroeconomic events for the forecasting analysis. Furthermore, the framework employs causal data augmentation powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and a causal contrastive learning approach to enhance the causal understanding and forecast accuracy of CAMEF."
